# People-Occupancy-Sensor
This is a prototype lorawan sensor that is made for a project for intelligent sensor networks. This sensor can collect data on ocupancy, temp, people-count, humidity and send it over lorawan.

## Why this project?
This project is for the subject intelligent sensor networks. Here by you needed to connect a sensor on a iot protocol. I choose for lorawan because it has the best range and i had the module at hand. 

# Required hardware
- AI thinkermodule ESP32 Cam
- Goovy board with the lora module
- DHT11 temperture sensor
- Pir-sensor
